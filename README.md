The name of my fictional start up is "The Inferno."  The Inferno is a high end athletic training club that offers a serious training enviornment for athletes.  The Inferno offers athletic training services, has individual training rooms available for booking, and sells apparel as well.  The individual training rooms would be available to all members, but would be specifically designed for social media influencers looking to record workout videos for their pages.  This allows them to be able to shoot a higher quality video with less background noise and movement.  The individual training rooms also allow the rest of the members training to focus on their workout.

I decided to make a new start up for this hw.  Hope that's alright :)
